**USING CONSENSUS TO BUILD DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS: Part 2**

[TOC]

# Overview #
The goals of this assignment are to use consensus to build a fault-tolerant replicated datastore application using one of the following three options:

1. A coordination protocol using Zookeeper as a logically centralized service accessible to all replicas;

2. Gigapaxos to encapsulate the application as an RSM;

3. Your own coordination protocol possibly using a globally accessible logically centralized file system or database for coordination (an option analogous to #1 but not forcing you to use Zookeeper).

Pre-requisites:

1. Java is required; Linux strongly recommended but not necessary for any of the three options above;

2. Familiarity with the [replicated consistent (non-fault-tolerant) datastore programming assignment (PA2)](https://bitbucket.org/avenka/590cc/src/master/consistency/);

3. Completion of [consensus and RSM tutorials (Part 1)](https://bitbucket.org/distrsys/consensus-rsm-tutorials/src/master/README.md?mode=edit&at=master).

You are already familiar with the application environment andd background here having completed pre-requisite #2 above. The goal in this assignment is to make your replicated, consistent datastore additionally fault-tolerant.
